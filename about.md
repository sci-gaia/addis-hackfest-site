## TL;DR

  * **The project** : The [Sci-GaIA project](http://www.sci-gaia.eu) aims to develop e-infrastructures in Africa and stimulate usage of advanced computing, data, and networking infrastructures, in order to accelerate scientific research. Sci-GaIA has several [activities](http://www.sci-gaia.eu/project-activities/), including [training](http://www.sci-gaia.eu/project-activities/training/)
  * **The Hackfest** : The hackfest is one format which we have adopted as a means of rapidly prototyping new applications and their integration into e-Infrastructures. The hackfest is a brutal sprint wherein research communities which have scientific applications are invited to work with e-Infrastructure service developers in a short sprint to bring new use cases online.
  * **The Community** : This is a level playground - we are all here to learn together and treat each other with support and respect. We strongly encourage strategic thinking, sustainable planning, community participation, open infrastructure and open source software. In short, we subscribe to the [Working Open](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/index.html) principles.
